Overview of Basic Calculator Program

Objective:
The objective of this Python program is to create a basic calculator that allows users to perform arithmetic operations on two numbers. The program prompts the user to enter two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). It then calculates the result based on the chosen operation and displays the result to the user.

Key Features:

User Interaction:

The program interacts with the user through the command-line interface (CLI).
It prompts the user to enter two numbers and choose an operation.
Operations Supported:

Addition (+): Adds two numbers together.
Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second number from the first.
Multiplication (*): Multiplies the two numbers.
Division (/): Divides the first number by the second. Handles division by zero gracefully.
Error Handling:

The program checks for division by zero and displays an appropriate error message if the user attempts to divide by zero.
Modularity:

Functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) are used to encapsulate the logic for performing each arithmetic operation.
This promotes code readability, maintainability, and reusability.
User Input Validation:

The program validates user inputs to ensure they are appropriate for the selected operation (e.g., numerical values for numbers, valid operation choices).
